## Professional 

I'm a cryptographer, with a focus on practical implementations, cryptanalysis, and protocols. 
You can find a link to my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=LItUNn4AAAAJ&hl=en).

I am currently a Senior Research Scientist in the Quantum Security Group at [SandboxAQ](https://www.sandboxaq.com/). 

For 2.5 years, I was employed as a Cryptography Engineer at [PQShield Ltd](https://dblp.org/pid/138/8975.html), a small spin-out company from the University of Oxford. Previously, I was a post-doc at the University of Bristol in the [SCA / Crypto group](https://github.com/sca-research) and at [CSIT](https://www.qub.ac.uk/ecit/CSIT/) where I also did my PhD. Other previous research positions and education history can be found in my [CV](files/CV.pdf).

## Research Interests

The focus of my research is mainly based around (but not limited to) post-quantum cryptography. My research has somewhat been focused on implementations (optimisations for hardware and software designs), physical implementation attacks (side-channel and fault attacks) and countermeasures. Also I have been researching protocols (such as KEMs, signatures, and beyond) and algorithmic optimisations.
