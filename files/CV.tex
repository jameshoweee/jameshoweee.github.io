\section{\textbf{Research Statement}} 

\vspace{0.25cm}

My research aims to bring principles and techniques from post-quantum cryptography, specifically lattice-based cryptography, to the design and implementation of secure and correct systems. To this end, I became an expert in the theory of lattice-based cryptography during my first year of PhD studies, the survey of which resulted in a journal paper. Using this knowledge as a basis significantly helped in understanding the motivations and design rationales of these lattice-based cryptographic scheme. Most of the remaining research during my thesis then followed from this which focused on designing architectures using optimisations which target specific devices such as FPGAs. My education up to this point focussed on applied mathematics (during my bachelor's degree) and cryptography and pure mathematics (during my master's degree), so I am very familiar with the mathematical side of cryptography.

%{\newline}{\newline} %I am now looking to use my expertise to make cryptography (ideally, lattice-based cryptography) more practical, to be used in real-world applications, for the benefit of secure communications. {\newline}{\newline}

\vspace{0.25cm}

I completed a research visit in 2015 at Ruhr-Universit\"{a}t, Bochum, with Thomas P\"{o}ppelmann and Tim G\"{u}neysu, funded by COST. For this research we investigated new techniques for the (essential) discrete Gaussian sampling component, as well as techniques to check the samplers' validity and correct functionality. This collaboration also resulted in a joint journal publication on lattice-based digital signature schemes. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

I also completed an internship with Thales Research and Technology in 2015 with Adrian Waller. During this internship, I targeted a highly secure lattice-based cryptographic scheme: standard LWE encryption. It was previously believed that this scheme, in fact any \emph{standard} lattice-based scheme, would perform badly in hardware. The hardware designs I proposed in fact competed with the corresponding encryption scheme over ideal lattices, with a slight increase in hardware resource consumption. This has been further improved after publication for inclusion in my PhD thesis, in which the design consumes less area. 

\vspace{0.25cm}

As a PhD student and Research Assistant, I also work with SAFEcrypto (\url{http://www.safecrypto.eu}), which has ties with a number of European research centres. The main outputs of this collaboration was a comprehensive evaluation of discrete Gaussian samplers in hardware and a low-area hardware design of Ring-TESLA, an ideal lattice-based signature scheme. The discrete Gaussian samplers proposed bettered all previous work in hardware, as well as offering constant run-time, which is preferable due to side-channel analysis. The hardware designs of Ring-TESLA provide generic hardware architectures, which allows ease of use with a number of different parameter sets. This hardware architecture has the potential for high throughput with a fast NTT multiplier. %I believe these types of collaborations will continue if I was selected to research at your prestigious university.

\vspace{0.25cm}

In 2017, I joined the side-channel and cryptography group at the University of Bristol, supervised by Elisabeth Oswald. Here I learnt a lot about side-channel analysis, a new field I am very interested in researching, particularly with respect to lattice-based cryptography. We have collaborated on many side-channel related projects, mainly focussed on novel countermeasures, plus I continue to collaborate with other research centres in the Hardware Security Group, Bochum, ALaRI Institute, Switzerland, and Temasek Laboratories, Singapore. During my research at Bristol I also continued to research hardware and software designs. A recent publication investigated a potential NIST key encapsulation post-quantum standard, named FrodoKEM, which I presented at T-CHES in collaboration with researchers at Ruhr-Universit\"{a}t, Bochum.

\vspace{0.25cm}

In early 2019, I began working at PQShield, a company specialising in post-quantum cryptography, as a Cryptography Engineer. My responsibilities here included research, profiling schemes on bare-metal targets, investigating side-channels, and designing countermeasures. I also contributed to InnovateUK funding submissions and doing the research and writing reports for this.
