## Professional 

I'm a cryptographer, with a focus on practical implementations and cryptanalysis. 
You can find a link to my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=LItUNn4AAAAJ&hl=en).

Since May 2019 I have been employed at [PQShield Ltd.](https://pqshield.com/) as a Cryptography Engineer. Previously I was a post-doc at the University of Bristol in the [SCA / Crypto group](http://www.bristol-sca.com). Other previous research positions and education history can be found in my [CV](files/CV.pdf).

## Research Interests

The focus of my research is mainly based around post-quantum cryptography, in particular lattice-based cryptography, and investigating them with respect to optimised hardware designs, software designs, side-channel attacks, fault attacks, and countermeasures.
