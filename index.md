## Professional 

I'm a cryptographer, with a focus on practical implementations, cryptanalysis, and protocols related to post-quantum cryptography. 
You can find a link to my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=LItUNn4AAAAJ&hl=en).

I currently lead the cryptography team at [SandboxAQ](https://www.sandboxaq.com/), where I manage our cryptographic research and guide the design and enhancement of our cybersecurity products. My work spans post-quantum cryptography, cryptographic modernization, and strengthening compliance and risk management capabilities.

At SandboxAQ we have a lot of great opportunities for [Residencies](https://www.sandboxaq.com/company/residencies), which can be for anyone from postgraduates to postdocs, for 3-12 months. Please feel free to get in [contact](https://jameshowe.eu/contact/) to informally enquire, I would be interested in topics (in PQC or others) ranging from FPGA or microcontroller designs, side-channel analysis and countermeasures, protocol design, crypto-agility, and developing our open-source tools at SandboxAQ. We also have other researchers, such as [Martin Albrecht](https://martinralbrecht.wordpress.com/2023/04/25/sandboxaq-internships/), who have other topics in mind.

I've had the pleasure of supervising Paula Alonso Blanco, Sanjay Deshpande, Kahlil Dozier, Georg Land, Tarun Yadav, as well as many others in a more informal setting.

For 2.5 years, I was employed as a Cryptography Engineer at [PQShield Ltd](https://dblp.org/pid/138/8975.html), a small spin-out company from the University of Oxford. Previously, I was a post-doc at the University of Bristol in the [SCA / Crypto group](https://github.com/sca-research) and at [CSIT](https://www.qub.ac.uk/ecit/CSIT/) where I also did a research fellowship and my PhD. Other previous research positions and education history can be found in my [CV](files/CV.pdf).

## Research Interests

The focus of my research is mainly based around (but not limited to) post-quantum cryptography. My research has somewhat been focused on implementations (optimisations for hardware and software designs), physical implementation attacks (side-channel and fault attacks) and countermeasures. Also I have been researching protocols (such as KEMs, signatures, and beyond) and algorithmic optimisations.
