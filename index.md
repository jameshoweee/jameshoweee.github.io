## Professional 

I'm a cryptographer -- a fellow who professionally builds and breaks
cryptosystems. Here's a recent [**CV**](doc/saarinen_cv.pdf) with 
a clickable list of publications. 

In September 2018 I will starting with PQShield Ltd. in Oxford. (A new 
spin-off of the Mathematical Institute, focusing on Post-Quantum Cryptography.)


### Research Interests

Focus of my current research is in quantum resistant cryptography and
next-generation lighweight symmetric ciphers.

[ROUND5](round5), a merger of earlier Round2 and Hila5 first-round candidates, 
is our official proposal in the 
[NIST Post-Quantum Crypto Project](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/post-quantum-crypto/).
